                the use of Puerto Rican slang, as reflected in songs like "Problemón." The album was developed during
                the pandemic, and the artist conceives it as a search for happiness, like the movie "Pursuit of
                Happiness."</p>

        <h2>ABOUT ALVARO DÍAZ</h2>
        <article>
            <p>Jorge Álvaro Díaz Rodríguez (San Juan, July 25, 1995) is a Puerto Rican singer and songwriter. Throughout
                his musical career, he has collaborated with several artists such as Tainy, Bad Bunny, Sebastián Yatra,
                Rawayana, Feid, Zion, Eladio Carrión, Yandel, Dalex, Cazzu, Rauw Alejandro, Mora, Jowell & Randy, Myke
                Towers, Jhayco, Nathy Peluso, Quevedo, Fuego, C. Tangana, among others.

                Álvaro Díaz was born on July 25, 1995, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He is the son of Jorge Díaz Reverón, a
                senior judge of the First Court of the Puerto Rican municipality of Caguas. In addition to his music, he
                has also worked as a publicist, but after improvising on tracks and recording, his melodies gained
                popularity in the Latin market.

                Álvaro Díaz began his musical career after uploading songs to SoundCloud in 2012, highlighting his debut
                track, "Chica de la Isla." During this time, he gained significant recognition, which led him to
                continue releasing songs.

                After his debut on the music scene, he continued releasing singles steadily between 2015 and 2016. His
                first album, "Hato Rey" (2015), was a tribute to his San Juan neighborhood. He planned to release an
                album in 2016 called "Díaz Buenos, Diaz Malos," which never materialized. Shortly after, he released his
                second album that same year: "San Juan Grand Prix."</p>
